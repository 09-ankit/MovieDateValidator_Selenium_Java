**Project Description:**
Title: Movie Date Checker

**Overview:**
The Movie Date Checker project aims to verify if the release dates of movies on two popular websites, IMDb and Wikipedia, are consistent. In this quality assurance project, we create test cases to ensure that when provided with a movie name, the system fetches the release dates from both websites and compares them. If the dates match, the test case is considered to have passed.

**Project Details:**
Objective: To validate the accuracy of movie release dates across different sources.
Functionality: The system takes a movie name as input, fetches release date information from IMDb and Wikipedia, and compares the dates.
Outcome: If the dates from both sources match, the test case is successful.
